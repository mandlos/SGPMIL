## Overview

Sparse Gaussian Process Multiple Instance Learning (SGPMIL) is a probabilistic attention-based framework for Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), designed to provide calibrated predictions and interpretable attention scores at both bag and instance levels. Built upon Sparse Gaussian Processes, SGPMIL addresses key limitations of prior probabilistic MIL approaches, including training instability, poor instance-level localization, and computational inefficiency.

The framework introduces three key improvements: (1) a learnable feature-scaling term in the variational posterior mean, (2) a relaxed sigmoid-based attention normalization strategy, and (3) a diagonal covariance approximation to accelerate and stabilize training. These modifications enhance optimization over kernel hyperparameters and inducing point locations while preserving predictive performance.

SGPMIL is evaluated on a wide range of histopathology benchmarks, including CAMELYON16, TCGA-NSCLC, BRACS, and PANDA, showing strong results in both bag-level classification and instance-level performance. The method provides an efficient, scalable, and theoretically grounded solution for high-dimensional MIL tasks.

## Structure

The repository is organized as follows:
```

│ └── main.py # Entry point for training and validation using PyTorch Lightning
└── README.md
```

### Installation

Option 1 – using pip:
```bash
# 1. Create a clean conda or venv environment
conda create -n sgpmil python=3.10 -y
conda activate sgpmil
